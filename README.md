# Drop Pod Shuttle

A RimWorld mod that adds a craftable drop pod shuttle for transporting Space Marines. Uses drop pod graphics and sounds, but flies horizontally like shuttles (limitation of using shuttle mechanics).

## Features

- **Craftable drop pod shuttle** (4x4 size)
- **Transports up to 10 Space Marines** (3000kg capacity)
- **Chemfuel-powered** (900 capacity, 5 per tile, 60 minimum)
- **1.5 hour cooldown** between launches
- **Paintable** to match your chapter colors
- **Closed state during flight**, open state when landed
- **Large explosion on landing** (5 tile radius)

## Known Limitations

- **Horizontal flight path**: Uses horizontal flight (like shuttles) rather than vertical drop pod movement. This is a technical limitation of using shuttle mechanics - the flight path is calculated from world map route direction, not configurable via XML.

## Compatibility

- **Choose Where To Land**: Compatible - allows manual selection of landing spots for the drop pod shuttle.

## Requirements

- **RimWorld 1.6**
- **Odyssey DLC** (required)
- **RimDark 40k - Mankinds Finest** (required for assets)
