# Drop Pod Shuttle

A RimWorld mod that adds a craftable drop pod shuttle for transporting Space Marines. The drop pod uses vertical-only movement (straight down landing, straight up takeoff) just like traditional drop pods, not horizontal flight like shuttles.

## Features

- **Craftable drop pod shuttle** (3x3 size)
- **Transports up to 10 Space Marines** (3000kg capacity)
- **Vertical-only movement** (drop pod style, not shuttle flight)
- **Chemfuel-powered** (900 capacity, 5 per tile, 60 minimum)
- **1.5 hour cooldown** between launches
- **Paintable** to match your chapter colors
- **Closed state during flight**, open state when landed
- **Explosion on landing** matching original drop pods
